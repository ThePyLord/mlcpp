## About
This is a C++ implementation of an fully connected neural network. It was inspired by an example in this book.

![Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Computer-Vision-with-TensorFlow-2/a8c9aa88eeb46d3ea81e36ea95b1b2c73f8036d8/banner_images/book_cover.png).

It is a work in progress and is not yet complete nor accurate enough for use.

## Building
Just run the following commands in the root directory of the project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./build/mlcpp
```
or put it in any directory you wish, but make sure CMake is accessible from that directory.

## Requirements
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- OpenCV for C++
- [matplotlibcpp](https://github.com/Cryoris/matplotlib-cpp) for plotting
